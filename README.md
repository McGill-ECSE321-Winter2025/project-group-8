## Info on Project Branches

```main``` is the stable branch of our project, it will capture the state of our project at ***deliverable submission*** time.

```main-development``` is where we push working features/code for our *current deliverable* that 
***passes tests*** and/or has been ***peer-reviewed*** by teammates.

```dev-{your_username}``` is the branch where you will work on your own tasks assigned to you for the deliverable so that if 
you write bad code here (we all do at one point), it won't affect ```main``` or ```main-development```.

## Commit Message Methodology

### Commit Types:
* ```Feature``` -> Implemented/worked on a feature
* ```Fix``` -> Bug fix, fixing broken stuff, etc.
* ```Maintain``` -> Minor changes that are more for quality of life

```<type of commit>: <short description of feature(s) affected/what was done>```

* ```Ex: Feature: Implementing email sending to customers upon successful cart checkout```
* ```Ex: Fix: Fixed bug where Bogo sort would not run in O(n!)```
* ```Ex: Mtn: Refactored code to make it more readable```

## Email Configuration

For the password reset functionality to work, you need to configure email credentials in your environment variables or in a `.env` file.

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` 
2. Update the email credentials in the `.env` file:
   ```
   EMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   ```

**Note for Gmail users:** If you're using Gmail and have 2-Step Verification enabled, you'll need to generate an App Password:
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security â†’ App passwords
3. Generate a new app password for the application
4. Use this password in the `.env` file instead of your regular password

The system will use these credentials to send password reset emails without requiring manual authentication through the console.

## JWT Configuration

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. You need to configure a secure secret key:

1. In your `.env` file, set a strong secret key that is at least 64 bytes (512 bits) long:
   ```
   JWT_SECRET=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZab
   ```

**Important:** 
- The JWT secret must be at least 64 bytes long as it's using the HS512 algorithm.
- The JWT secret must NOT contain hyphens or special characters that are invalid in Base64 encoding. Use only letters, numbers, and underscores.
