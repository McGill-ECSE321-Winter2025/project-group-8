# Info on Project Branches

```main``` is the legacy branch of our project, it will capture the state of our project at ***deliverable submission*** time.

```main-development``` is where we push working features/code for our *current deliverable* that 
***passes tests*** and/or has been ***peer-reviewed*** by teammates.

```dev-{your_username}``` is the branch where you will work on your own tasks assigned to you for the deliverable so that if 
you write bad code here, it won't affect ```main``` or ```main-development```.
