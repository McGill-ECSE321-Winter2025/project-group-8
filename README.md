# Info on Project Branches

```main``` is the legacy branch of our project, it will capture the state of our project at ***deliverable submission*** time.

```main-development``` is where we push working features/code for our *current deliverable* that 
***passes tests*** and/or has been ***peer-reviewed*** by teammates.

```dev-{your_username}``` is the branch where you will work on your own tasks assigned to you for the deliverable so that if 
you write bad code here, it won't affect ```main``` or ```main-development```.

# Commit Message Names

Try to be informative of your commit messages so that people other than you are going to be able to understand what the hell
is going on in that commit.

We can try to do it like this, if it doesn't work for you guys just let me @dyune know.

### Commit Types:
* ```Feature``` -> Implemented/worked on a feature
* ```Fix``` -> Bug fix, fixing broken stuff, etc.
* ```Maintain``` -> Minor changes that are more for quality of life

```<type of commit>: <short description of feature(s) affected/what was done>```

* ```Ex: Feature: Implementing email sending to customers upon successful cart checkout```
* ```Ex: Fix: Fixed bug where Bogo sort would not run in O(n!)```
* ```Ex: Mtn: Refactored code to make it more readable```
